# Experience Philippines 🌴

Experience Philippines is a revolutionary travel platform that reimagines how tourists discover destinations in the Philippines. Instead of the traditional destination-first approach, users explore through experiences - from pristine beaches and majestic mountains to vibrant festivals and authentic local cuisine.

## 🎯 Mission

Our platform has two core missions:

1. **Democratizing Tourism** - We level the playing field between small local businesses and large commercial establishments. A family-owned restaurant can shine just as brightly as a chain, and a charming B&B can compete with luxury hotels based on the authentic experiences they offer.

2. **Gamifying Travel** - We transform Philippine tourism into an engaging adventure through gamification. Travelers earn badges, unlock achievements, and share their journey with a community of fellow explorers.
